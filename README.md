## What is the difference between git and github?
Git is a version control system that helps you manage changes in your code and collaborate with others. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that provides hosting, collaboration, and other tools to help you work with Git repositories.

## Name 3 benefits of a version control system:
1. Keeps track of changes and allows for easy version control.
2. Enables collaboration with other team members on a project.
3. Helps to quickly identify and resolve errors and bugs in the code.

## Name 3 alternatives to git:
1. Mercurial (very similar to Git)
2. SVN (centralized, for enterprise environments)
3. Perforce (particularly for large-scale projects, like in the game industry)

## Name 2 differences between git and other version control systems:
1. Git is a distributed version control system, which means that each developer has a full copy of the repository on their local machine, while other systems, such as SVN, are centralized.
2. Git uses a different approach to branching compared to other version control systems, which allows for faster and more flexible development workflows.

## Name known issues related to game engines (Unreal, Unity) and version control systems:
1. Large file sizes: Game engines generate large files, which can cause issues with version control systems, particularly with Git, which can become slow and unwieldy when dealing with large files.
2. Binary file conflicts: Game engines often use binary files, such as textures and 3D models, which can create conflicts when multiple team members are working on the same files simultaneously.
3. Incompatibility with certain version control systems: Some game engines may not be compatible with certain version control systems, requiring specific plugins or configurations to work effectively, which can create additional complexity and potential issues.
4. Difficulty in managing project dependencies: Game engines often have many external dependencies, such as plugins, libraries, and other assets. Managing these dependencies can be challenging, particularly when working with multiple team members or trying to integrate changes from external sources. This can create issues with version control systems and make it more difficult to track changes and collaborate effectively.
